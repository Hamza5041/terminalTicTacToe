Basic Tic Tac Toe game on a terminal between two players.

Only 1 rule: please only enter positive integers or -1 when asked for where you would like to play (row and position).

Utilizes basic loops and conditionals to handle semantics.

Used code from chat gpt to pretty print the board, rest is my own work.
